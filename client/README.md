- npm or yarn
- A running instance of the [FlowBoard Backend API](https://github.com/your-username/backend-repo-link).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/frontend-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/frontend-repo-name.git)
    cd frontend-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the following:
    ```env
    # The base URL of the backend API
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```
    *Replace `http://localhost:5000/api` with the actual URL if your backend is running elsewhere.*

4.  **Run the development server:**

    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).
