## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
- A Google Gemini API Key

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `server` directory and set up the environment variables.

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:

```env
# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>

# The port for the backend server
PORT=5000

# Your Google Gemini API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the `client` directory and set up the environment variables.

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the following variable:

```env
# The base URL of your backend API
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 4. Running the Application

You'll need two separate terminal windows to run both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.

**In the first terminal (from the project root):**

```bash
# Start the backend server
cd server
npm run start
```

**In the second terminal (from the project root):**

```bash
# Start the frontend Vite development server
cd client
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).
